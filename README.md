----------------------
## General Discription:
The application once you open it you will see a board that is not interactive unless you press start. You can either start by randomly generating a board or check test to get a predefined test case to see that the game is working. <br />

    The test board is solved in 4 moves:
      1.  press 11
      2.  press 10
      3.  press 14
      4.  press 15

Once you end up solving your board either the test or the randomly generated you shall revieve a congratulations dialog that you can only exit by pressing the Discard button within. You then have the option to Play Again by pressing the button and remember to check or uncheck the test check box upon your needs. <br />

    Side Notes:
      1. You can restart the board at any given time.
      2. When you play an invalid move a toast message will be displayed telling you it is invalid.

## Application Issues:
Based on the testing done during the making of this application, no issues happened to have occured.

    I tested my application on the emulator on these following devices:
      1. Pixel Phone API 35
      2. Nexus One API 35
      3. Small Phone API 35
      4. Meduim Phone API 35
    I also tested it on a physical device (Samsung Galaxy S10+)
-----------------
## Implementation Difficulties Faced:
1. Getting to understand how everything is connected was tricky at first given it is the first time building an app and use Android Studio.
2. Dealing with the emulator
3. Debugging at first but used logcat to go about it
4. Dealing with lambda expression as the syntax is different
